I am a 1st year PhD student in Geography & Geographic Information Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC)](https://illinois.edu) under the guidance of [Prof.Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen). I am currently a research assistant at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu).
My research focuses on large language models, machine learning, continual learning, and applications in spatial analysis, remote sensing, etc.

Before joining UIUC for my PhD, I earned my Bachelor’s(Geographic Information Science) and Master’s degree(Survey and Mapping) from [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn), where I conducted research on _Open world high-resolution remote sensing image scene classification based on memory mechanism_ under the guidance of [Prof. Haifeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=51p_SJAAAAAJ).
